## 📂 IBM - AI-Based Image Compression Using Deep Learning

**Description:**  
This project implements an **AI-based image compression system** using **Deep Learning** techniques. The system is built with **Django** for the backend and leverages models such as **GANs** to optimize image storage and transmission efficiency.

**Key Features:**
- Developed using Python and Django.
- Trained on high-resolution images (DIV2K dataset).
- Reduces image size with minimal quality loss.
- Ideal for bandwidth-constrained environments.

**Technologies Used:**
- Django
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (GAN)
- DIV2K Dataset
- HTML/CSS for frontend

## 📂 INDUSTRY - Tree Detection & Spatial-Temporal Analysis

**Description:**  
This project focuses on **Tree Detection** using **Deep Learning models** applied to satellite or aerial imagery. It includes **spatial-temporal analysis** to monitor tree cover changes over time.

**Key Features:**
- Uses semantic segmentation or object detection models (e.g., Mask R-CNN or YOLO).
- Spatial analysis using tools like QGIS/GeoPandas.
- Tracks changes over multiple time intervals to analyze deforestation or afforestation trends.

**Technologies Used:**
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Remote sensing data
- Spatial analysis libraries (GeoPandas, Rasterio)
- Python visualization tools (Matplotlib, Folium)
